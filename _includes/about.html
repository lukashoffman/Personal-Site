        	<p class="large text-muted">This is my personal website, and is here to showcase who I am, and the things that I like to do. More than anything, it's here to apply the skills I've learned in an internship with the Chicago Department of Innovation and Technology, a real-world application of the time I've invested there. The site runs a Jekyll instance, serving through Github Pages. To view the source code for this site, click <a href="https://www.github.com/lukashoffman/personal-site">here</a>.
